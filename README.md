# Cancer Prediction - Machine Learning

## Introduction:
Early cancer detection is critical in improving patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions and more effective treatment strategies. This project aims to leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict three prominent types of cancers: oral, cervical, and brain tumors.

## Rationale:
This project is motivated by the significant potential of machine learning in transforming healthcare. By detecting cancer at its earliest stages, medical professionals can begin treatment sooner, greatly improving the chances of successful outcomes. Through the use of advanced computational methods, this project seeks to develop a sophisticated predictive model capable of analyzing both medical images and risk factor data to identify potential cases of oral, cervical, and brain cancers in their early stages.

## Objectives:
- **Develop and optimize machine learning models** for the early detection of oral, cervical, and brain tumors.
- **Utilize diverse datasets** that combine medical images and risk factor data for training and evaluation.
- **Assess model performance** using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
- **Integrate predictive models into clinical practice**, enhancing diagnostic capabilities for cancer detection.

## Project Structure:
- **/Code**: Contains the source code for the machine learning models.
- **/Dataset**: Includes the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- **/Models**: Stores the trained models for future use.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for training and evaluation is located in the `/Dataset` directory. It is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), and it includes both medical images and risk factor data for the three types of cancers (oral, cervical, and brain).

## Evaluation Metrics:
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly predicted instances.
- **Sensitivity**: The proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
- **Specificity**: The proportion of actual negatives correctly identified.
